# DAIRN Book Package v0.1

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

## Scope

A `.dairn` is a portable distribution container around an authored DAIRN book.
It was introduced in Issue #5. It does not replace Markdown, define game
mechanics, or depend on StoryPlayer or Telegram implementation details.

## Physical format

The file extension is `.dairn`. Its bytes are a standard ZIP archive using
UTF-8 entry names and UTF-8 text files. Entries are relative slash-separated
paths; absolute paths, empty path components, and `..` are invalid. Unknown
safe files are preserved and ignored by readers that do not understand them.

Archive root contains no enclosing book directory. Required entries are:

```text
dairn-package.yaml
book.yaml
```

`dairn-package.yaml` is created by the packager:

```yaml
package-format: dairn-book-package
package-version: "0.1"
book: book.yaml
```

Readers must reject a package they cannot open, an absent manifest, another
format name, another package version, or another book entry point. Compatible
future versions may add optional fields and files; an incompatible version
must be reported, not guessed.

## Book layout

The supplied pilot is the baseline and contains:

```text
book.yaml
artwork/
catalogs/
memory/
canon/
stories/<story-id>/story.yaml
stories/<story-id>/chapters/*.md
stories/<story-id>/artwork/
```

Only `book.yaml` and the resources it references are required by this package
specification. The other directories are optional. `book.yaml` identifies the
starting story; its story manifest identifies the starting chapter and each
chapter source. A package reader must not assume every optional directory
exists.

## Structured heroes

`book.yaml` may contain a `heroes` list. Every listed hero requires a stable,
unique `id`; `name` is optional and its absence is meaningful. A package reader
exposes this list as structured data and does not derive hero fields from prose
or other authored resources. The package is immutable at runtime: a name
provided by a reader belongs to a game session, not to this manifest.

## Minimal validation

Validate ZIP readability, safe paths, package manifest/version, `book.yaml`,
the start-story reference, story-source references, start-chapter references,
chapter-source references, and duplicate story/chapter IDs. This is deliberately
not a full narrative-schema or rules validator. Each present chapter is also
checked for duplicate scene IDs and `goto` targets absent from that chapter.

## First-chapter consumer profile

A consumer that only needs an opening-context image reads `book.yaml`, its
`start-story`, that story's `start-chapter`, then the chapter source for the
chosen language. It may use that chapter's authored text and explicitly
referenced canon as context, and stops after rendering the image. It must not
silently read later chapters or claim their events as current context.

For the supplied pilot this resolves to `first-trial` → `chapter-01` →
`stories/first-trial/chapters/chapter-01.ru.md`. The package nevertheless
contains all book resources unchanged.

## License boundary

This package specification is Apache-2.0. Content licenses remain independent
and must be carried in existing metadata or documented by the book publisher;
packaging never relicenses content.
